      You are in a room void of anything. 
      It's not pleasant, but it's not unpleasant.

      There is an opening to the north through which
      you can see a big swamp.

      It's quiet in here, the creeking from the frogs
      outside has stopped and been replaced by the 
      sounds of insects and other creatures.

      You can see the swamp to the west and a passage
      leading south further down the cave.

      Cave walls surround you in all directions. Hard,
      cold and uninviting stone seems to be the only
      things in this place. You feel a sense of calm.

      The only way back is to the north from where you
      came.
